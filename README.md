# Trip Planner REST API

In this project I've created a REST API using Node.js and Express.
This API exposes a set of GET and POST endpoints to allow getting data out, and sending data in.
I used a MongoDB database to store this data.

The application is a trip cost calculator app.

## What does the app do

- manage a list of trips
- track expenses for each of those trips

## Built with

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Acknowledgements

The project was created as a part of [The Javascript full-stack bootcamp](https://thejsbootcamp.com/) from Flavio Copes
